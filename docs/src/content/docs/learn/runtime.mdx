The Wails runtime is the standard library for Wails applications. It provides a
number of features that may be used in your applications, including:

- Window management
- Dialogs
- Browser integration
- Clipboard
- Menus
- System information
- Events
- Context Menus
- Screens
- WML (Wails Markup Language)

The runtime is required for integration between Go and the frontend. There are 2
ways to integrate the runtime:

- Using the `@wailsio/runtime` package
- Using a pre-built version of the runtime

## Using the npm package

The `@wailsio/runtime` package is a JavaScript package that provides access to
the Wails runtime from the frontend. It is used in by all the standard templates
and is the recommended way to integrate the runtime into your application.
By using the `@wailsio/runtime` package, you will only include the parts of the runtime that you use.

The package is available on npm and can be installed using:

```shell
npm install --save @wailsio/runtime
```

## Using a pre-built local version of the runtime

Some projects will not use a Javascript bundler and may prefer to use a
pre-built version of the runtime. This is the default for the examples in
`v3/examples`. The pre-built version of the runtime can be generated using the
following command:

```shell
wails3 generate runtime
```

This will generate a `runtime.js` (and `runtime.debug.js`) file in the current
directory. This file can be used by your application by adding it to your frontend project:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="./runtime.js"></script>
    </head>
    <!--- ... -->
</>
```
